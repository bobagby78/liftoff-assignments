## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	The What’s Sup? web application will solve the age-old problem of "What's for dinner?" by giving thoughtful (or thoughtless) recommendations in a multitude of ways. Nearly everyone on Earth has spent evenings cooling their heels until something tasty to eat comes to mind. At one point on those evenings, many of those same people are willing to try just about anything new and doable. The results delivered to the user by What’s Sup? can be absolutely random, calculated randomly based on selected criteria the recipe must meet, or precisely what a user searches to find. No one ever has to settle for that same thing they make every Wednesday again.
	A user can make an account, enter cooking or food preparation skills they have, ingredients they possess, along with the working kitchen equipment available to them, and the amount of time from now till when they need to eat. Upon selecting the desired criteria and entering any information, the user will be met with a display of all the recipes within the database that meets said criteria. If a user runs out of a	particular ingredient, they are able to click to swiftly remove it from their possessed ingredients and it will be added to a shopping list of items they are to get when they shop next, keeping them able to continue on to new recipes. Users can also add their own recipes along with a picture of their real, in-person finished product.### Features
